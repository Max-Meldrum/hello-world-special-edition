\begin{abstract}
Since being introduced in the book "The C Programming Language", Hello World has become the typical way of how people are introduced to the world of programming. We observe that the classical approach is conservative, all characters are displayed solely through one programming language. In this paper, we propose an improved version which allows new developers to run Hello World with multiple languages.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Instructing the computer to display text on the screen is the most common first program that any developer will encounter. The concept of Hello World became popular through\cite{Kernighan:1988:CPL:576122}. 

\section{Algorithm}
In our implementation, we have opted to go for "Hello World!" instead of "Hello, World!". In total, including the white space, we have 12 characters. Any number of languages is supported, as long it is able to compile on the target computer. It is not guaranteed that the 12 selected languages are unique, the algorithm will pick randomly from a basket.
